The data used for this assignment is as follows:
* **Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures** (`GlobalTemperatures.csv`) which contains the following data:
  1. `dt` = *the date which starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures*
  2. `LandAverageTemperature` = *the global average land temperature in degrees celsius*
  3. `LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty` = *the 95% confidence interval around the average land temperature*
  4. `LandMaxTemperature` = *the global average maximum land temperature in degrees celsius*
  5. `LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty` = *the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature*
  6. `LandMinTemperature` = *the global average minimum land temperature in degrees celsius*
  7. `LandMinTemperatureUncertainty` = *the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature*
  8. `LandAndOceanAverageTemperature` = *global average land and ocean temperature in degrees celsius*
  9. `LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty` = *the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature*
